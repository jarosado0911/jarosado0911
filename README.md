### Hi there üëã
üëã Hi, I'm James Rosado ‚Äî Applied Research Mathematician, Software Integration Engineer, and Cryptologic Mathematician

With over a decade of experience spanning government, academia, and applied research, I specialize in developing software solutions at the intersection of mathematics, neuroscience, and national security. I hold a Ph.D. in Mathematics from Temple University and currently serve as an applied mathematician at the U.S. Department of Defense.

üîß My work bridges theory and application: from building real-time virtual neuron simulators in Unity and mesh generation tools in C++/Python, to implementing machine learning-based recommendation systems and parallel computing pipelines using MPI and OpenMP.

üß† My projects integrate:
Computational neuroscience (e.g., Neuro-VISOR, NeMo-TMS, CalcSim)
Secure, high-performance scientific computing
Applied cryptologic algorithms
Full-stack software workflows using GitHub, CMake, SonarCloud, and CI/CD

üîê I maintain a security clearance and actively contribute to technical publications and government R&D efforts. My repositories reflect open-source efforts in mesh generation, neuron modeling, and scientific computing infrastructure.
