### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Contact information can be found on the left most panel - feel free to browse my recent and public projects.
I am currently in the process of updating this account and slowly fill in all my codes. First, I have everything private for a while until I get everything organized, one by one I will be making my repositories public!
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on organizing my homeworks
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use ug4, neurocollection, and program C#
