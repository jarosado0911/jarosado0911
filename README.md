### Hi there 👋
Contact information can be found on the left most panel - feel free to browse my recent and public projects.
I am currently in the process of updating this account and slowly fill in all my codes. First, I have everything private for a while until I get everything organized, one by one I will be making my repositories public!
- 🔭 I’m currently working on organizing my homeworks
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use ug4, neurocollection, and program C#
- 😄 I am also adding my exercises I am doing on my own for learning C++
- I am also adding Java Script exercises I am working on
